- Class: text
  Output: The stringr package is wonderful for working with strings in R. Most
    of the functions in stringr take the same two arguments, a string and then
    a regex.

- Class: text
  Output: However before we get into stringr functions let's cover some of the
    fundamental string functions in R that use regular expressions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In previous lessons we’ve been using grepl() to see if a regex 
    matches a string. grepl() stands for "grep logical." Try out grepl() below
    by entering grepl("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky")) into the
    R console.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))')
  Hint: Just type grepl("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There’s also the old fashioned grep() which returns the indices of 
    the vector that match the regex argument. Enter grep("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))
    into the R console to test it out.
  CorrectAnswer: grep("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grep("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))')
  Hint: Just type grep("[Ii]", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What would the expression grep("[Aa]", c("Florida", "Alabama", "Idaho"))
    be evaluated to?
  AnswerChoices: 1 2 3;2 3;1 3;1 2
  CorrectAnswer: 1 2 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '1 2 3')
  Hint: If you're struggling, try it yourself in the R console!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The sub() function takes as arguments a regex, a “replacement,” and a
    vector of strings. This function will replace the first instance of that 
    regex found in each string. Try out sub() by entering
    sub("[Ii]", "1", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky")) into the R console.
  CorrectAnswer: sub("[Ii]", "1", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sub("[Ii]", "1", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))')
  Hint: Just type sub("[Ii]", "1", c("Hawaii", "Illinois", "Kentucky"))
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on
    Coursera.org?"
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No;Generate Code
  AnswerTests: coursera_on_demand()
  Hint: ""
