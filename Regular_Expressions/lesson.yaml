  Output: Now that we’ve covered the basics of string manipulation in R, 
    let’s discuss the more advanced topic of regular expressions. A regular 
    expression is a string that defines a pattern that could be contained 
    within another string. A regular expression can be used for searching for 
    a string, searching within a string, or replacing one part of a string with 
    another string. In this lesson I might refer to a regular expression as 
    a regex, just know that they’re the same thing.

- Class: text
  Output: Regular expressions use characters to define patterns of other 
    characters. Although that approach may seem problematic at first, 
    we’ll discuss meta-characters (characters that describe other characters) 
    and how you can use them to create powerful regular expressions.
    
- Class: text
  Output: One of the most basic functions in R that uses regular expressions 
    is the grepl() function, which takes two arguments - a regular expression 
    and a string to be searched. If the string contains the specified regular 
    expression then grepl() will return TRUE, otherwise it will return FALSE.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let’s contruct an example using grepl() with a string and a regex.
    First assign the regex "a" to a variable called regular_expression.
  CorrectAnswer: regular_expression <- "a"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='regular_expression <- "a"')
  Hint: Just type regular_expression <- "a"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next assign the string "Maryland" to a variable called 
    string_to_search.
  CorrectAnswer: string_to_search <- "Maryland"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='string_to_search <- "Maryland"',)
  Hint: Just type string_to_search <- "Maryland"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use grepl() to see whether regular_expression is present in
    string_to_search.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(regular_expression, string_to_search)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl(regular_expression, string_to_search)')
  Hint: Just type grepl(regular_expression, string_to_search)

- Class: text
  Output: In the previous example we specify the regular expression "a" and store 
    it in a variable called regular_expression. Remember that regular 
    expressions are just strings! We also store the string "Maryland" in a 
    variable called string_to_search. The regular expression "a" represents 
    a single occurrence of the character "a". Since "a" is contained 
    within "Maryland", grepl() returns the value TRUE.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following expressions would return the value FALSE?
  AnswerChoices: grepl("u", "Maryland");grepl("M", "Maryland");grepl("a", "Maryland")
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("u", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'grepl("u", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Which character is not present in "Maryland" ?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try a few more examples. Before you enter each comming into
    the R console, try to guess what the result will be (either TRUE or FALSE).
    Type grepl("ryla", "Maryland") into the R console.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("ryla", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("ryla", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("ryla", "Maryland")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now try typing grepl("Marly", "Maryland") into the R console.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("Marly", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("Marly", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("Marly", "Maryland")

- Class: text
  Output: Since "ryla" is a sub-string of "Maryland", grepl() returns TRUE, 
    however when a regular expression like "Marly" is searched grepl() 
    returns FALSE because it is not a sub-string of "Maryland".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: There’s a dataset that comes with R called state.name which is a
    vector of strings, one for each state in the United States of America.
    We’re going to use this vector in several of the following examples. Let's
    take a look at this vector by entering head(state.name)
  CorrectAnswer: head(state.name)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(state.name)')
  Hint: Just type head(state.name)

- Class: text
  Output: Let’s build a regular expression for identifying several strings in 
    this vector, specifically a regular expression that will match names of 
    states that both start and end with a vowel. The state name could start 
    and end with any vowel, so we won’t be able to match exact sub-strings 
    like in the previous examples. Thankfully we can use metacharacters to 
    look for vowels and other parts of strings.

- Class: figure
  Output: I'm opening up a table of metacharacters that I'll be refering to
    for the rest of the lesson.
  Figure: metatbl.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: The first metacharacter that we’ll discuss is ".". The metacharacter 
    that only consists of a period represents any character other than a new 
    line (we’ll discuss new lines soon).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try using this metacharacter. Enter grepl(".", "Maryland") into
    the R console to see if there is one instance of any character present.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(".", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl(".", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Just type grepl(".", "Maryland")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try one more time using this metacharacter. Enter 
    grepl(".", "") into the R console.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl(".", "")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl(".", "")')
  Hint: Just type grepl(".", "")

- Class: text
  Output: There aren't any characters in an empty string, there this expression
    is evaluated to FALSE.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As you can see the period metacharacter is very liberal. This 
    metacharacter is most userful when you don’t care about a set of 
    characters in a regular expression. Enter 
    grepl("a.b", c("aaa", "aab", "abb", "acadb")) into the R console to see what
    happens.
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("a.b", c("aaa", "aab", "abb", "acadb"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("a.b", c("aaa", "aab", "abb", "acadb"))')
  Hint: Just type grepl("a.b", c("aaa", "aab", "abb", "acadb"))

- Class: text
  Output: In the previos case grepl() returns TRUE for all strings that contain 
    an "a" followed by any other character followed by a "b".

- Class: text
  Output: You can specify a regular expression that contains a certain number 
    of characters or metacharacters using the enumeration metacharacters.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The "+" metacharacter indicates that one or more of the preceding 
    expression should be present and "*" indicates that zero or more of the 
    preceding expression is present. Use grepl() to see if the string "Maryland"
    contains one for more of "a"
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("a+", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("a+", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("a+", "Maryland")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now use grepl() to see if the string "Maryland"
    contains zero for more of "x"
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("x*", "Maryland")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("x*", "Maryland")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("x*", "Maryland")

- Class: text
  Output: 'You can also specify exact numbers of expressions using curly 
    brackets {}. For example "a{5}" specifies "a exactly five times,"
    "a{2,5}" specifies "a between 2 and 5 times," and "a{2,}" specifies 
    "a at least 2 times."'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use grepl() to see if the string "Mississippi" contains exactly
    two adjacent "s" (using curly brackets).
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("s{2}", "Mississippi")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("s{2}", "Mississippi")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("s{2}", "Mississippi")
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use grepl() to see if the string "Mississippi" contains two or three
    adjacent "i" (using curly brackets).
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("i{2,3}", "Mississippi")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("i{2,3}", "Mississippi")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("i{2,3}", "Mississippi")

- Class: text
  Output: In addition to curly brackets you can use parentheses "()" to create
    a capturing group. A capturing group allows you to use quantifiers on other
    regular expressions. Let's use a capturing group to see if the string
    "Mississippi" contains the substring "iss" twice.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type grepl("(iss){2}", "Mississippi") into the R console to see if
    the substring "iss" exists twice adjacently in the string "Mississippi"
  CorrectAnswer: grepl("(iss){2}", "Mississippi")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='grepl("(iss){2}", "Mississippi")')
  Hint: Just type grepl("(iss){2}", "Mississippi")
